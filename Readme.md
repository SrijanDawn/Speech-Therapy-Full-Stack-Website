# Speech Therapy Clinical Services Website

This project is a web-based platform aimed at digitizing the entire process of speech-language therapy services. It helps rehabilitation institutes and speech therapy clinics manage their case loads by offering features such as case allocation, therapy documentation, evaluations, feedback, and clinical ratings.

### The system caters to three main types of users:

- Patients: who can track their therapy sessions and progress.
- Therapists: who document and manage therapy plans and sessions.
- Supervisors: who allocate cases and evaluate therapists' performance.


## Features
- Home Page: An engaging, user-friendly landing page with a dark mode toggle option.
- User Dashboard: Personalized dashboards for patients, therapists, and supervisors with access to relevant features.
- Case Allocation: Automated or manual assignment of cases to therapists.
- Therapy Documentation: Therapists can document therapy plans, track progress, and maintain session records.
